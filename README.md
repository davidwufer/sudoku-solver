Background
---------
When I fly on Southwest Airlines, I usually attempt the sudoku in the provided magazine. However, I've never been able to complete it due to the amount of repetition and the amount of time commitment needed to finish these puzzles, and so I've decided to automate all the repetition to solve what my lack of patience could not.

Design
------
 - Need to check by row, column, and quadran
 - Make a playable game first
